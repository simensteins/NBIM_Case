Subject: QUANTITY_OR_LENDING_MISMATCH discrepancy — Nestle SA (COAC 970456789)

We have identified an entitlement quantity mismatch for Nestle SA on NBIM bank account 823456791. Custody cash reflects 12,000 shares at CHF 3.10 (CHF 37,200 gross; CHF 24,180 net), while NBIM booked 10,000 shares (CHF 31,000 gross; CHF 20,150 net). The resulting net cash difference is CHF 4,030. Dates, currency (CHF), and a 35% tax rate align.

NBIM records show NOMINAL_BASIS 10,000, consistent with net CHF 20,150. Custody amounts appear calculated on 12,000 shares at the same rate; however, the custody NOMINAL_BASIS field shows 10,000 and custody indicates LOAN_QUANTITY 0 and LENDING_PERCENTAGE 0. Ex-date is 25.04.2025 and pay date is 29.04.2025.

Please review and confirm the entitled quantity at record date and reconcile the discrepancy between the reported NOMINAL_BASIS and the cash paid. If 10,000 is correct, kindly arrange an adjustment of CHF 4,030; if 12,000 is correct, please confirm and provide supporting details or documentation so we can align our booking.
