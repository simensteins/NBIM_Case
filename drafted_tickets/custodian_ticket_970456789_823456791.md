Subject: QUANTITY_OR_LENDING_MISMATCH discrepancy — Nestle SA (COAC 970456789)

We have identified an entitlement mismatch for Nestle SA in CHF on bank account 823456791. Custody paid the dividend on 12,000 shares, while NBIM’s entitlement is 10,000 shares. The resulting net cash difference is CHF 4,030 in the settlement currency.

NBIM booked net CHF 20,150 (10,000 × 3.1 × 65%). Custody reported net CHF 24,180 with gross CHF 37,200 (12,000 × 3.1) and 35% tax. Custody data shows NOMINAL_BASIS 10,000 but HOLDING_QUANTITY 12,000 with LOAN_QUANTITY 0. Event dates appear aligned on both sides (Ex 25-Apr-2025, Pay 29-Apr-2025).

Please review and confirm the dividend entitlement quantity at record date for bank account 823456791, and advise whether the additional 2,000 shares were included in error or reflect a valid allocation (e.g., late trade or sub-account). If an adjustment is required, kindly confirm the reversal/next steps and provide any supporting documentation.
