Subject: AMOUNT_MISMATCH_TAX discrepancy — Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (COAC 960789012)

We have identified a tax-related cash discrepancy for Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on bank account 712345678. Custody cash exceeds NBIM by 342.77 USD in USD settlement currency. This appears to stem from a tax-rate application difference rather than dates or lending.

NBIM records the dividend on 25,000 shares (gross 9,025,000 KRW at 361). Custody applied 20% tax (1,805,000 KRW), resulting in net 7,220,000 KRW and 5,524.27 USD. NBIM applied approximately 25% total tax (22% WHT of 1,985,500 KRW plus ~2.985% local tax of 269,550 KRW; total 2,255,050 KRW), resulting in net 6,769,950 KRW and 5,181.50 USD. The QC variance of 450,050 KRW broadly maps to the USD cash delta. We note IS_CROSS_CURRENCY_REVERSAL=true and a lending quantity of 2,000 shares; however, NOMINAL_BASIS matches (25,000), and the variance tracks tax rather than quantity or timing. Context: ex-date 31-Mar-2025; payment 20/25-May-2025.

Could you please review and confirm the tax treatment applied, specifically whether 22% WHT plus the local surtax (~2.985%) should apply, or if only 20% WHT is correct? Please advise whether the additional 2% WHT and local surtax will be collected or adjusted, and confirm if any different treatment applies to the lent portion. Supporting documentation would be appreciated, along with guidance on next steps.
