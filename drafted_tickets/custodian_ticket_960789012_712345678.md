Subject: AMOUNT_MISMATCH_TAX discrepancy — Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (COAC 960789012)

We have identified a tax/amount discrepancy on the Samsung Electronics Co Ltd dividend settled in USD on bank account 712345678. Custody’s net cash is higher by USD 342.77 (NBIM USD 5,181.50 vs custody USD 5,524.27).

NBIM booked 22% withholding plus ~2.985% local surtax (~25% total), giving 6,769,950 KRW net (DIV 361 × 25,000), which converted to USD 5,181.50. Custody applied 20% tax only (TAX 1,805,000 KRW), resulting in 7,220,000 KRW net and USD 5,524.27. Both sides used the same dividend rate and nominal (361; 25,000). A custody loan quantity of 2,000 was noted, but gross entitlement was based on full nominal on both sides. Dates largely align; NBIM shows payment 20.05.2025 while custody shows 25.05.2025, but the mismatch is tax-driven. Event ex-date 31.03.2025 (ISIN KR7005930003).

Could you please review and confirm the actual tax rate and breakdown applied by HSBC Korea, and advise whether treaty relief was applied or the local surtax is not applicable? If 20% is correct, we will adjust NBIM’s booking; otherwise, please amend custody records/cash and share supporting documentation. If any cross-currency reversal flag applies, please confirm it does not impact the net tax outcome.
