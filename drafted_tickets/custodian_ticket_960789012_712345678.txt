Subject: AMOUNT_MISMATCH_TAX discrepancy — Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (COAC 960789012)

We have identified a tax-rate discrepancy on the dividend for Samsung Electronics Co Ltd impacting BANK_ACCOUNT 712345678 in USD. Custody’s net cash is higher by 342.77 USD versus NBIM. NBIM recorded 5,181.50 USD while custody paid 5,524.27 USD.

Both sides show a dividend rate of 361 KRW on 25,000 shares (gross 9,025,000 KRW). Custody applied a 20% tax (1,805,000 KRW), resulting in a net of 7,220,000 KRW. NBIM accrued 22% WHT plus ~3% local tax (total ~25%), with taxes of 1,985,500 KRW and 269,550 KRW, resulting in a net of 6,769,950 KRW. The net QC gap is 450,050 KRW (~5% of gross), driving the USD difference. We also note custody’s IS_CROSS_CURRENCY_REVERSAL flag is true and the payment dates differ (NBIM 20-May vs custody 25-May), while quantities match.

Please review and confirm the correct Korean dividend withholding applied for KR7005930003 for this account, and whether a local surtax should apply (total ~25%) or if a 20% relief-at-source rate was intended. Kindly advise if any adjustment is pending in light of the cross-currency reversal flag and provide supporting documentation or guidance on next steps.
