Subject: QUANTITY_OR_LENDING_MISMATCH discrepancy — Nestle SA (COAC 970456789)

We have identified an entitlement quantity mismatch for Nestle SA on bank account 823456791. Custody appears to have paid on 12,000 shares, while NBIM’s entitlement is 10,000, resulting in a net cash variance of 4,030.00 CHF in CHF.

NBIM records net 20,150.00 CHF, while custody shows 24,180.00 CHF. The dividend rate is 3.10 CHF with 35% withholding on both sides. Custody’s NOMINAL_BASIS field displays 10,000 shares, yet the cash amounts reflect 12,000 shares, implying an extra 2,000 shares; lending is not a factor (LOAN_QUANTITY 0; LENDING_PERCENTAGE 0%). Dates align (Ex 25-04-2025; Pay 29-04-2025). The variance reconciles to (12,000 − 10,000) × 3.1 × (1 − 0.35) = 4,030.00 CHF.

Please review and confirm the record-date entitlement and correct or reverse the excess 2,000-share booking so the payment reflects 10,000 shares. Kindly provide custody booking details and any issuer/custodian documentation. Separately, please clarify the noted Possible Restitution Amount of 4,500 CHF and, if applicable, advise next steps via a separate instruction.
